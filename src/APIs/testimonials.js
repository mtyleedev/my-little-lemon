        description: "Huge restaurant with good service.  The grilled octopus is the winner on the menu.  The salads were bland and nothing ordinary.  The vegetarian stuffed pepper with rice came with lamb??  The service and the staff is very friendly and accommodating which made up for the OK food.",

        description: "I love this place with all tasty food. I went with family and I ordered some Greek appetizers like eggplants, okra, mixed grilled veggies, artichokes, cauliflower, grilled shrimp, and calamari. We got free dessert from the house so delicious. I recommend this place for anyone who wants to enjoy Greek cuisine.",
